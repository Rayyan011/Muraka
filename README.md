# ðŸ§  Muraka â€” AI for Coral Reef Health Detection

**Muraka** is an AI-powered coral health monitoring system developed to support marine conservation efforts in the Maldives and beyond. By combining state-of-the-art deep learning models with localized underwater imagery, Muraka identifies and classifies coral species and their health status, enabling scalable, data-driven ocean preservation.

## ðŸŒŠ Project Goals

- Detect coral presence using object detection (YOLOv8m)
- Classify coral health using image classification (ResNet-50)
- Support marine researchers and conservationists with automated insights
- Provide scalable tools for reef monitoring across the Maldives and similar ecosystems

## ðŸ§ª Technologies Used

- **YOLOv8m** â€“ Coral detection (bounding box level)
- **ResNet-50** â€“ Coral health classification (healthy, bleached, diseased)
- **Python** â€“ Core development
- **PyTorch / Ultralytics** â€“ Model training and inference
- **OpenCV** â€“ Image processing
- **Pandas & NumPy** â€“ Data manipulation
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** â€“ Visualization
